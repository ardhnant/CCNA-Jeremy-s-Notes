## REST API Authentication 

- Authentication is the process of validating the identity of a user or system to ensure legitimate access to resources.  
	- In the case of an API, the resource is the application and its data.

- Without authentication, unauthorized users can send API requests, potentially accessing sensitive data or modifying the application.  
	- Implementing a reliable authentication method is essential for protecting applications and data.

- Many APIs track usage for analytics and billing purposes.  
	- e.g., charging customers according to how much they use the API.

### Types of REST API Authentication

- REST APIs use various types of authentication to verify client identity and secure access to resources.  
	- These are also called methods or schemes.

We will cover four:
- Basic authentication:  
	- Sends a username and password in every request, encoded in Base64.

- Bearer authentication:  
	- Uses a token (bearer token) as an HTTP header in each the request to verify the client’s identity.

- API key authentication:  
	- Requires a unique key, typically included as an HTTP header, to authenticate API requests.

- OAuth2.0:  
	- A secure framework that grants access via access tokens, commonly used for delegated access and third-party authentication.

## Basic Authentication 

Basic authentication includes a username and password in the HTTP headers of each API request for authentication.

- These credentials are encoded in Base64 format but not encrypted.  
	- Base64 is an encoding scheme, which is simply a way of representing data.  
	- Unlike encryption, it is not secure and can easily be decoded.  
	- Always use HTTPS (TLS) for security.

- The username/password are sent in the format username:password, encoded in Base64.  
	- For example, jeremy:ccna would be sent as amVyeW15OmNjbmE=  
	- You can encode/decode Base64 at [https://www.base64decode.org/](https://www.base64decode.org/)

Advantages:  
- Simple and easy to implement.

Disadvantages:  
- Since credentials are sent in every request, attackers could steal them if the connection is not properly secured.  
- Even if using HTTPS for encryption, relying solely on a username/password combination isn’t particularly secure.

## Bearer authentication 

- Bearer authentication (a form of token-based authentication) uses a token instead of a username/password.  
	- The client first obtains a token by authenticating with an authorization server.  
		- This can be done using using Basic authentication or another method.  
	- For each API call, the client includes the token in the HTTP Authorization header.  
		- e.g., Authorization: Bearer ya29.a0ARrdaM8

- The term bearer means that anyone who possesses the token can use it.  
	- If an attacker steals the token, they can make API calls as if they were the legitimate user.  
	- To mitigate against this, tokens expire after a set period of time.

Advantages:  
- More secure than Basic authentication (no need to transmit the same username/password for every API call).  
- Tokens expire, so a stolen token will only be temporarily valid.

Disadvantages:  
- If a token is stolen, the attacker can access the API until it expires.  
- Tokens need to be refreshed periodically, adding extra complexity to implement.  
- Should only be used with HTTPS.

## API key authentication 

- API key authentication uses a static key issued by the API provider. 
	- The client uses this key in each API call for authentication.  
	- Unlike bearer tokens, the API key is static and remains valid until revoked.

API keys can be sent in:  
- The HTTP Authorization header (recommended)  
- The URL (e.g., add ?api_key=abcd1234 to the end of the URL)  
	- Not recommended! URLs are often logged by web servers, proxies, browsers, etc.  
- A cookie (sometimes used for browser-based APIs).

Advantages:  
- Easier to implement than Bearer authentication (no need to refresh tokens).  
- Good for tracking API usage. Often used by cloud services and third-party APIs.

Disadvantages:  
- If stolen, the key grants full access until revoked.  
- API keys must be rotated manually to maintain security, whereas tokens expire automatically.

## OAuth 2.0 

OAuth 2.0 is a secure authentication framework that is widely used in modern web applications.  
- It provides access delegation, granting third-party applications limited access to resources on behalf of the resource’s owner.  
	- There is no need to share the resource owner’s credentials with the third party.

Examples of OAuth 2.0:  
- Logging in with Google:  
	- Many websites and apps offer the option to log in using your Google account.
- Connecting apps to social media accounts:  
	- Many apps can be connected to accounts on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
- Calendar integration:  
	- A third-party tool can be given access to your Google Calendar to check availability and schedule meetings.

The OAuth2.0 authentication/authorization process consists of six steps:
1. The client app requests authorization from the resource owner (you) to access the resource (your Google Calendar data).
2. The resource owner grants authorization by logging into their account (e.g., Google account) and giving permission.
3. The client app exchanges the authorization grant for an access token from the auth server.
4. The auth server provides an access token to the client app.
5. The client app sends the access token to the resource server (e.g., Google’s server hosting calendar data) to request the resource.
6. The resource server validates the access token and provides the requested resource (calendar data) to the client app.

The access token granted in step 4 functions just like the token used in bearer authentication.  
- It grants access to the specified resource within the appropriate scope of access (e.g., read-only access).  
- Access tokens expire after a short period, but OAuth2.0 uses refresh tokens (granted by the Auth server) to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in every time.
